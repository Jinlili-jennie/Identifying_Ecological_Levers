# Identifying ecological levers for microbially driven water treatment using an interpretable machine-learning framework

This repository provides example code and datasets from our study on interpretable machine learning for microbial biofilters. We developed a framework to identify keystone taxa and ecological indicators (Ks, Kf) that significantly enhance pollutant removal prediction across global biofilter samples. The approach integrates deep ecological modeling, microbial keystone analysis, and transparent machine learning (e.g., SHAP) to reveal how microbial communities shape treatment performance.
